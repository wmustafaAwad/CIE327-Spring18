# CIE327-Spring18
Probability and Stochastic Processes Course Project - Designing an N-level PAM transmitter-receiver with Matched Filter for Noise

From the Project Description File:

"You are required to understand the design principles of a matched filter and the
mathematics therein, and use MATLAB Simulink to simulate a digital channel
producing a graph that depicts the relation of the bit error rate and the signal to noise
ratio. You should consider 2-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and more
generally M-levels PAM and provide the symbol error probability in both cases.


Repeat previous simulations using MATLAB codes instead of Simulink and compare
the SNRS results for different AWGN values and for different PAM pulses. Comment
on your results."


The Code and Simulink was created by us Under Guidance of Eng. Aya Abdelgawad


Use 'plotter.m' to Plot Error Rate vs SNR  (Exponential Decay)
Use 'Project.m' for a single transmission-receiving operation with the required number of levels 
Use 'PAMmodem.slx' for a PAM simulator
